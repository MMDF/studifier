# The Ultimate Studifier! Helps you study!
  Yes the name is weird. But it is fitting. This python program is developed to help you(me too!) study! The first version developed under 30 minutes!
### Takes 2 parameters
  The first is the filename that contains the data, the second is the mode you want. We have 2 modes first one is "e" for explicit, the second one is "ne" for non-explicit.

  Explicit mode: your answer is explicitly compared(case-sensitive) with the correct answer and only prints if it was correct or incorrect.

  Non-explicit mode: your answer is taken, then your answer and the correct answer are printed out.
### Still a long way to go
  This project is public and if you have any issues or new ideas you know where to put'em(issues section up top). If you want your idea to be in the project just make a pull request and if it fits the contribution rules, I'll push it.
## How do you set it up?
  Just download as a zip, extract and run the main.py from cmd on Windows and terminal on macOS/Linux with 2 parameters shown in the 2nd section ^^^. You might want to edit the data in the file, though it's pretty basic and non-useful.

# Contact the developer <3
  My email is ben@mehmetefeakca.me, just send an email my way ^-^. You can also just message me on twitter @trMMDF or send a message over Github. There is no way you can't contact me.
